# Vision-Arcadia Project

I used sequential CNN to build a model to recognize hand gestures like :

• Numbers
  ‣ One
  ‣ Two
  ‣ Three
  ‣ Four
  ‣ Five
  
• Symbols
  ‣ Fist ✊
  ‣ Ok 👌
  ‣ Swag 🤘
  ‣ Thumbs Down 👎
  ‣ Thumbs Up 👍
  ‣ Yo 🤟

I then deployed the trained model to automate laptop keys and then used RPi to simulate two machine projects :
  1) Alarm Clock
  2) Soda Machine
