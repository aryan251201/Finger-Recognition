First run the test.py file for both the gestures and numbers model and save these models on your local m/c and then load them in codes for RPi

You may need to install many libraries for the project such as 
"Open CV"
"Tensorflow"
"Keras"
"PyAutoGUI"

If you get an error : ModuleNotFoundError => install missing library on m/c

model can be saved by using command : model.save("<name>.h5")
